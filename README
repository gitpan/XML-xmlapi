XML-xmlapi

The xmlapi was originally written as a structure manipulation library for
ANSI C in my ill-fated wftk project in the year 2000.  (Yeah.)  I've kept
it forever, obviously, and ported it into Perl and Python as I got more into
those languages.

Now, I find I'm just too attached to it.  So with the advent of the
semantic programming framework, it's the structure manipulation library of
choice.  My choice, anyway.  It's lightweight, so you'll hardly know it's
there.

Seriously, it's not too bad a choice for tree-shaped data.
